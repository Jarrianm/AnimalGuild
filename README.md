# Motivation: 

Itâ€™s difficult for even A-list actors to land the role they want, amateur actors even more so. But with all that being said people seem to forget that there is a market for all of our furry friends to be on the big screen too. 

This application was built for casting directors or even film students to find and cast Animal actors in their films or personal projects.
